# Azure Data Engineering

## Project Overview

The **Azure Data Engineering** project demonstrates the implementation of a modern data engineering pipeline using Microsoft's Azure ecosystem and other technologies. The pipeline is designed to process, transform, and visualize data efficiently while adhering to the **Medallion Architecture** for a structured approach to data lake organization.

---

## Tech Stack Used

1. **SQL Server (On-Premises):**

   - Acts as the source system for data extraction.

2. **Azure SQL Server:**

   - Cloud-hosted relational database for storing structured, transformed data.

3. **Azure Blob Storage:**

   - Serves as a scalable data lake for raw and intermediate data storage.

4. **Azure Data Factory (ADF):**

   - Orchestrates ETL/ELT pipelines to extract, transform, and load data between various systems.

5. **Azure Databricks:**

   - Used for large-scale data processing and transformations, particularly for complex data engineering workflows.

6. **Power BI:**

   - Business intelligence tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations from the processed data.

7. **Medallion Architecture:**

   - Ensures the pipeline adheres to a structured framework with three distinct layers:
     - **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion.
     - **Silver Layer:** Cleansed and enriched data.
     - **Gold Layer:** Aggregated and analytics-ready data.

8. **RTL (Real-Time Layer):**

   - Enables real-time processing for use cases requiring low-latency data insights.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:**

  - Extracts data from on-premises SQL Server and ingests it into Azure Blob Storage using Azure Data Factory.
  - Transforms raw data into analytics-ready formats using Databricks and ADF.
  - Stores structured data in Azure SQL Server for downstream consumption.

- **Scalable Data Architecture:**

  - Implements the Medallion Architecture to ensure scalability, reusability, and maintainability of data.

- **Real-Time Processing:**

  - Includes a real-time processing layer for use cases such as streaming data analytics or real-time dashboards.

- **Interactive Dashboards:**

  - Provides actionable insights through Power BI reports and dashboards.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion:**

   - Extract raw data from on-premises SQL Server.
   - Load raw data into the Bronze Layer (Blob Storage).

2. **Data Transformation:**

   - Process data in Databricks to clean and enrich it (Silver Layer).
   - Perform advanced transformations for analytical purposes (Gold Layer).

3. **Data Storage:**

   - Store transformed data in Azure SQL Server for easy querying and integration with BI tools.

4. **Data Visualization:**

   - Develop Power BI dashboards for visualizing KPIs and insights.

5. **Real-Time Processing:**

   - Incorporate streaming data pipelines for real-time analytics when needed.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Setup Azure Services:**

   - Configure Azure SQL Server, Blob Storage, and Data Factory.
   - Set up Databricks workspace and clusters.

2. **Deploy Pipelines:**

   - Import ADF pipelines into Azure Data Factory.
   - Create Databricks notebooks for transformations.

3. **Ingest Data:**

   - Use ADF to extract data from on-premises SQL Server to Blob Storage.

4. **Transform Data:**

   - Run Databricks notebooks to process and transform data through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

5. **Visualize Data:**

   - Connect Power BI to Azure SQL Server or Gold Layer outputs and build dashboards.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support for additional data sources (e.g., APIs, third-party databases).
2. Implement CI/CD for automated pipeline deployments.
3. Optimize real-time processing with Azure Event Hub and Stream Analytics.
4. Introduce advanced analytics with ML models in Databricks.
